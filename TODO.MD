Centralized Management: Create a central management module that initializes and manages all critical components of the application, such as loading stylesheets, scripts, and other resources.

Resource Allocation: Implement a mechanism to manage and allocate resources efficiently, similar to how a kernel manages system resources. This could involve caching frequently used resources, lazy loading non-critical resources, and freeing up unused resources.

Error Handling: Build a robust error-handling system that can detect, log, and recover from errors gracefully. This will ensure the stability and reliability of your application.

Event Handling: Create a centralized event-handling system that manages all user interactions and system events. This will provide a consistent and efficient way to handle events throughout your application.

Modularity: Organize your code into modular components that can be easily managed and maintained. This will make it easier to update and extend your application in the future.

Performance Monitoring: Implement performance monitoring and logging to track the application's performance and identify potential bottlenecks. This will help you optimize your application's performance over time.
