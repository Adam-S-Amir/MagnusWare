# MagnusWare Dev Channel

MagnusWare, formerly known as MagnusSoft, is an operating system created primarily for the purpose of testing and developing a desktop environment. My inspiration for delving into OS development as a potential career came from reading Andrew S. Tanenbaum's "Modern Operating Systems" and "Distributed Operating Systems" textbooks.

## FAQ

#### Why use JavaScript, & jQuery?

The languages are easy to write in and the most critical functions and components of an operating system can be easily replicated using JavaScript & jQuery.

#### Did you create this by hand?

Yes...and no. My primary inspiration for creating MagnusWare was [Windows96.net](https://windows96.net). I observed that it had a somewhat plain appearance and felt that I could enhance it. The challenge of creating my own desktop environment was also a motivating factor. While I drew design inspiration from other JavaScript-based desktop environments, I drew inspiration from GitHub and DID NOT directly copy and paste any code.

#### Where did you get your icons from?

Any and all icons have been recreated using Photopea, or sourced directly from game files.
